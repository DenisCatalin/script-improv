## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- An OpenAI API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd script-improv
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory
   - Add your API keys:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: ElevenLabs API for high-quality character voices
# Get your API key from: https://elevenlabs.io/speech-synthesis
# If not provided, the app will fallback to browser TTS
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
